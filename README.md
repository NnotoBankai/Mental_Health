### Data Sourcing Deliverables
I have chosen the dataset from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/mental-health-care-in-the-last-4-weeks! 

To explain a little about the data, from the website itself it states: "The U.S. Census Bureau, in collaboration with five federal agencies, launched the Household Pulse Survey to produce data on the social and economic impacts of Covid-19 on American households. The Household Pulse Survey was designed to gauge the impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness".

I created the dictionary and uploaded it into my google drive. This is the shareable link:

The output of my first script describes loading the data and viewing some of the first rows in jupyter notebook

This output will show how i processed and cleaned the dataset a bit by checking for missing values, and convert date columns into date objects in jupyter notebook

Over here ia a sample output from a code that I manipuated, and inserted into Mongodb to answer my business question: What is the prevalence of mental health medication usage across different age groups?
