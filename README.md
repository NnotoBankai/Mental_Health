## CIS4400 Homework
### Data Sourcing Deliverables
I have chosen the dataset from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/mental-health-care-in-the-last-4-weeks! 

To explain a little about the data, from the website itself it states: "The U.S. Census Bureau, in collaboration with five federal agencies, launched the Household Pulse Survey to produce data on the social and economic impacts of Covid-19 on American households. The Household Pulse Survey was designed to gauge the impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness".

The output of my first script describes loading the data and viewing some of the first rows
