## CIS4400 Homework

I have chosen the dataset from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/mental-health-care-in-the-last-4-weeks! 

To explain a little about the data, from the website itself it states: "The U.S. Census Bureau, in collaboration with five federal agencies, launched the Household Pulse Survey to produce data on the social and economic impacts of Covid-19 on American households. The Household Pulse Survey was designed to gauge the impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness".

I created the data dictionary and uploaded it into my google drive. This is the shareable link:

To import my dataset into Mongodb, I had to convert the original csv file into a json file using a script in Jupyter Notebooks. Then I used a bash script with the mongoimport tool to import the converted json file into my Mongodb collection.
